# 2025-11-04 TODO

## Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify dependencies installed (`uv sync`)
- [ ] Install BPD packages (core, drivers, vhdl)

## Basic Usage
- [ ] Run quickstart example (`quickstart.py`)
- [ ] Query DS1120A capabilities
- [ ] Test voltage validation with different Moku platforms

## Testing
- [ ] Run Python unit tests (`pytest bpd/bpd-core`, `bpd/bpd-drivers`)
- [ ] Run VHDL CocoTB tests (`pytest bpd/bpd-vhdl/tests`)

## Exploration
- [ ] Review driver registry mechanism
- [ ] Explore VHDL FSM implementation
- [ ] Check integration with moku-models/riscure-models

## Notes
- Starting to build habit of daily TODO tracking
- Focus: understand how to use BPD as designed
